# THIS IS NOT A CONFIG FILE. `plugin.yml` is an internal file which is read by the Bukkit plugin
# loader. Do not modify this file unless you know what you are doing, you can easily break things.

# We're keeping this at 1.13 purely to disable Bukkit's legacy support system from firing.
# Old Minecraft versions such as 1.13 are not supported, nor is compatibility guaranteed for them.
# However, raising the api-version would prevent Polyconomy from running on those unsupported
# servers without any specific technical limitation providing a reason to.
api-version: "1.13"

# Soft/optional third-party plugins which are directly integrated with by Polyconomy
softdepend:

  # Treasury soft-dependency: Treasury is the recommended economy API that administrators should
  # use in combination with Polyconomy to unlock all of its features, in contrast to the Vault
  # hook, which is considered 'legacy'. Polyconomy has a Treasury hook, utilising a few of its APIs
  # (Economy, Services, Events).
  - "Treasury"

  # Vault soft-dependency: Vault is an alternative economy API which most servers use. It can be ran
  # in parallel with Treasury, although they serve different purposes. The Vault Economy API is not
  # expansive enough to cover a significant amount of Polyconomy's features. It also requires all
  # economy interactions to be done synchronously (on the main thread), which can lock up the server
  # if the administrator has a slow database solution and/or an inefficient economy service provider
  # plugin. Polyconomy has a Vault hook, utilising its Economy API only.
  - "Vault"

# Handled via Maven filtration.
