# THIS IS NOT A CONFIG FILE. `plugin.yml` is an internal file which is read by the Bukkit plugin
# loader. Do not modify this file unless you know what you are doing, you can easily break things.

# We're keeping this at 1.13 purely to disable Bukkit's legacy support system from firing.
# Old Minecraft versions such as 1.13 are not supported, nor is compatibility guaranteed for them.
# However, raising the api-version would prevent Polyconomy from running on those unsupported
# servers without any specific technical limitation providing a reason to.
api-version: "1.13"
