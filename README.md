# Polyconomy

Polyconomy is a **work in progress** economy core for your Minecraft server.

**The plugin is in very early development. Although somewhat functional, you should not use it in its current state.**

It has the goal of being reliable, robust, powerful, performant, featureful, and free.

Polyconomy has a single job: tie your server's economy together in an effortless and dependable manner. It will *not* offer 'bloated' features e.g. jobs, markets, shops, currency conversion, etc. The in-game commands aim to stay simple to use and understand, akin to EssentialsX's economy commands.

It's designed to offer a bunch of features you don't commonly find elsewhere, such as multi-currency support, full Towny Advanced support, full Vault Legacy / Vault Unlocked / Treasury API support, async storage I/O (Treasury API only), and a range of configuration options offering a variety of database or flatfile storage mediums.

We're slowly but surely building up a to-do list of what needs to be
done [here](https://github.com/orgs/ArcanePlugins/projects/10/views/1).
